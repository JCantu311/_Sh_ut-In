# Game 1
Attempt #1 at making a game, built in C and originally written for Windows.

I'll try to make it compatible with macOS and Linux.

## Game Synopsis
A terminal-based, text-based adventure/horror game. The game itself is written in C, while the Documentation is loaded as an HTML file with JavaScript to add functionality and CSS to enforce coloring, fonts, and font size.
It is an adventure/horror game which takes place in an unknown, linear building.
